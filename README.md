**FinSight AI is an intelligent platform designed to analyze real-time market conditions by synthesizing structured financial data and unstructured news sentiment. The system identifies distinct market 'regimes' or 'states' to provide a clear, high-level view of current financial turbulence.**

This project moves beyond simple indicators by using unsupervised machine learning to discover hidden patterns in the market, helping users understand the prevailing risk environment at a glance.

## üéØ The Problem

In today's volatile financial markets, investors are inundated with a constant stream of disconnected data points‚Äîstock prices, economic reports, breaking news, and social media chatter. It's challenging to consolidate this information into a single, coherent understanding of the market's risk level. Traditional methods often lag and fail to capture the impact of public sentiment.

## ü§ñ Our Solution

FinSight AI addresses this challenge by creating a unified view of the market. It leverages an automated data pipeline to:
1.  **Aggregate Key Data:** Ingests critical market indicators (like the S&P 500 and VIX) and real-time news from around the web.
2.  **Analyze Sentiment:** Applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to quantify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of financial news.
3.  **Identify Market Regimes:** Uses a K-Means clustering algorithm to group days with similar financial and sentiment characteristics. Each cluster represents a distinct **market regime**, such as "Low Volatility & Bullish Sentiment" or "High-Risk-Off Environment".
4.  **Visualize:** Presents the current market regime and supporting data on an intuitive, interactive web dashboard.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Automated ETL Pipelines:** Built with **Apache Airflow** to reliably fetch and process data from various sources without manual intervention.
* **Multi-Source Data Aggregation:**
    * **Unstructured Data:** Real-time news sentiment analysis from the News API.
    * **Structured Data:** Key market indices from Yahoo Finance (`'SP500', 'VIXCLS', 'T10Y2Y'`, etc.).
* **Unsupervised Market Regime Clustering:** Employs a **K-Means** model to classify the current market environment into predefined risk-based clusters.
* **Scalable Object Storage:** Uses **Minio** as a robust and scalable storage backend for raw data, processed features, and model artifacts.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** A clean and user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit** to visualize the current market regime, sentiment trends, and key financial indicators.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture & Workflow

The entire process is orchestrated by Airflow, ensuring a seamless flow of data from ingestion to visualization. Data is stored centrally in Minio, decoupling storage from compute and allowing for greater scalability.

## üß† Model Details

### Market Regime Clustering

The core of this project is the **K-Means clustering** model.

* **Features Used:** The model is trained on a dataset containing daily values for key market indicators (`OHLCV` of `SP500`, `VIXCLS`, `T10Y2Y`, etc.) combined with the aggregated news sentiment score for that day.
* **Objective:** The algorithm groups days with similar market characteristics into a predefined number of clusters (e.g., K=4).
* **Interpretation:** Each cluster represents a distinct **market regime**. By analyzing the centroid (average values) of each cluster, we can assign a qualitative label, such as:
    * Cluster 0: Calm / Low Volatility
    * Cluster 1: Bullish Momentum
    * Cluster 2: Bearish / Risk-Off
    * Cluster 3: High Uncertainty / Transitional

When new data comes in, the model assigns it to one of these clusters, providing an immediate classification of the current market state.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage & Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the application running.

1.  **Start all services with Docker Compose.**
    Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2.  **Set up and trigger the Airflow DAGs.**
    * Open your web browser and navigate to the Airflow UI (usually `http://localhost:8080`).
    * Log in with the credentials `admin` and password `admin`.
    * You will see two DAGs. Enable them using the toggle switches and trigger them to run.

3.  **Launch the FinSight AI Dashboard.**
    Once the DAGs have successfully run and processed the data, run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your dashboard will now be live and accessible in your browser.
